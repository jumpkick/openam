maintainer: Stein Myrseth <stein.myrseth@forgerock.com>
description: |
  OpenDJ is the only 100 percent open-source big data platform that combines the security of a proven directory with the accessibility of a database. Lightweight and easy to embed, it allows you to easily share real-time identity data across enterprise, cloud, social and mobile environments - a practical necessity for managing today identity relationship management challenges (IRM). 
  With OpenDJ, you no longer need to be an LDAP expert; choose either LDAP or REST to access identity data using a single solution that can replicate data across on and off-premise applications.
